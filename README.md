# income-predicrtion
This is a 2-class classification problem (income high or low). There are 32561 instances and 14 features. Target value is the last (income) column, 0 for low income, 1 for high income. There are no missing values, but some values are categorical (like education and marital status). to be processed by most machine learning algorithms.
I performed different classification methods and apply best practices we have seen in the lectures such as grid search, cross validation, regularization and feature extraction/selection (if relevant).
